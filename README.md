### Seamlessly compare your output with the required output :D 

## Bugs
If you stumble upon one of the many bugs that exist, please create an issue and I will try to fix it. If you want to fix an issue yourself, I'm open to any PRs (I believe this counts for HacktoberFest).

## Credits
Thank you to the creators of text-diff (the text comparison tool that I used)!
