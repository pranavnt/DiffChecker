# Diffcheckr

Seamlessly compare your output with the required output :D

If you stumble upon one of the many bugs that exist, please create an issue and I will try to fix it. If you want to fix an issue yourself, I'm open to any PRs (I believe this counts for HacktoberFest).

Thank you to the creators of text-diff (the text comparison tool that I used)!
